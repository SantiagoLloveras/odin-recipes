    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bulgogi (불고기), also known as Korean BBQ beef, is marinated thinly sliced beef, typically cooked over an open flame.</p>
    “Bul” means fire in Korean, and “gogi” is a general term for meat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1<sup>1/4</sup> pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Asian pear</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet</li>
        <li>2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 sliced green onion tops for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl.
            Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat.
            When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around
            the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
    </ol>
